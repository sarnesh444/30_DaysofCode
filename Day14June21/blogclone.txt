Here are my learnings for today I have completed the Blog clone of the course

*Objective: Creating a blog for the user to perform CRUD operations

* Should be a superuser to signup

* login to create a post

* adding the medium editor eg.bold,h1,h2

* edit the post to be visible in the list view

* time stamp for the date of creation and publishing

* Until the post is published it stays in the drafts section

* Once the post is published it can be moved to the list view,day of creation need not be equal to the day of publishing

* Update the post by making changes

* Author of the post(superuser who created the post)can delete the post

* Without logging in anybody can comment on the post

* Author can choose to approve or delete the comment

* Only if the author approves the comment it will be visible in the list view
