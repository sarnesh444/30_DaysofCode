* advantages of class based views over function based views

* rendering template from a class based view

* Detail view to return the details of a particular model from the class based view inherting DetailView from django.utils

* List view to return the list of records of a particular model from the class based view inherting ListView from django.utils

* Create/saving input details from a django form to the model which in turn commits to the dB by inherting the createview 

* Read the details from a model
